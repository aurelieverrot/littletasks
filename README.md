# Little Tasks

Covid-19 striked while I was preparing my Software Engineering bootcamp. With two kids at home, I had to be a mom and a  teacher while being a student connected online from 9am to 5pm.
My kids were in 3rd and 5th grade, with a lot to do everyday on their computers. But what will do a 11 year old with a computer when mom can't watch? Write a piece of opinion about a book or spend his day on Youtube to watch soccer videos?

I imagined something to help them take responsability of their workload everyday: a to do list with rewards!
It helps parents to keep track of what they have to do everyday, and what is done.
